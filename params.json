{"name":"A Pattern Graph","tagline":"Graph analysis of A Pattern Language","body":"### A Pattern Language\r\nChristopher Alexander's 1977 _A Pattern Language_ provided a sequence of vignettes, sketches, concepts - patterns for thinking about architecture and urban design. Each of the patterns builds upon and references others. In Alexander's words:\r\n\r\n> Since the language is in truth a network, there is no one sequence which perfectly captures it. But the sequence which follows, captures the broad sweep of the full network; in doing so, it follows a line, dips down, dips up again, and follows an irregular course, a little like a needle following a tapestry.\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough this project, I hope to provide a way to step back and view this tapestry as a whole. And learn a bit about d3.js along the way.","google":"UA-49237613-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
